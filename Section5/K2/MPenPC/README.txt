The program files are for the implementation of our MPenPC method proposed in the paper Joint Skeleton Estimation of Multiple Directed Acyclic Graphs for Heterogeneous Population (Jianyu Liu, Wei Sun, and Yufeng Liu, 2018; Submitted to Biometrics). 

A complete list of the programs:

JDAG_head.r
JDAG_Trials.r
JDAG_Functions_Estimate.r
JDAG_Functions_Examine.r
JDAG_Functions_Label.r
JDAG_Functions_Test.r
Functions_Display.r
Functions_Gaussian.r
Functions_Graph.r
Functions_Matrix.r


The main program is in JDAG_Trials.r. It will load the functions and R packages, and perform a simulation trial of the paper. One can perform simulations with different settings by modifying the parameters (all with explanation in the program). Other files contain the support functions for method implementation and result evaluation.
